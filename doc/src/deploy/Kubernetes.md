# Deploying to Kubernetes

> NOTE: This section is **outdated**.

Eventually, as Kubernetes eats the world, this will be **THE** way to run your **Gopherbot** robot. It's the platform of choice for my own production robot, `Data`, who runs my CI/CD pipelines and other jobs. For now, this is somewhat experimental. If you have a k8s cluster, and [helm 3](https://helm.sh/), see the `README.md` in `resources/helm-gopherbot` of the **Gopherbot** archive.
