# Using Gitpod

[Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) is a pretty good way to work with your robot's CLI, with the caveat that your robot needs to be stored in a public repository to use the free service. The standard robot includes a `.gitpod.yml` file, so if you've already signed up for **Gitpod** you can just visit: https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/\<org\>/\<robot-repo\>, or click the **Gitpod** button if you've installed the [browser extension](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/browser-extension).

When your workspace opens, you can use the `File` menu to create a new `.env` file directly in the `/workspace` folder. Once you've pasted in the contents and saved the file, just start the robot in the lower terminal pane:
```
gitpod /workspace $ gopherbot
