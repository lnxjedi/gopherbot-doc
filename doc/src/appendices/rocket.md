# A.2 Rocket.Chat

[Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat/) is currently the only other network-based team chat protocol for **Gopherbot**, coded as a fallback in the event that **Slack** changes the API in a ChatOps un-friendly way. When it was written, the **Go** library for **Rocket.Chat** lacked some basic functionality, so it was forked to an internal version. This protocol is not currently well supported, and could use some TLC from a developer using the protocol.
