# Nullconn

The **null** connector is not actually able to communicate with users, and was written to support installation and bootstrapping code. In theory, the **null** connector could be used in production as an alternative to e.g. cron, running jobs developed with the **terminal** connector; however, no known users are doing this and it's currently unsupported for this use.
