# CI/CD with GopherCI

**GopherCI** is a very new and still somewhat experimental collection of jobs, plugins and tasks for automating software builds and deployments. That being said, **Data** uses it all the time for building and pushing **Gopherbot** container images, and updating documentation.

If you're looking for a light-weight and chat-centric CI/CD solution - and if you're a python developer - there's no harm in trying it out for your own projects. PR's welcome!
