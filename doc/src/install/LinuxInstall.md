# Installation on Linux

> Up-to-date with v2.6

Note that Gopherbot is currently Linux-only. Earlier versions ran on MacOS - and even Windows (with support for PowerShell plugins!) - but these platforms have fallen out of use. Patches are welcome if you'd like to maintain one of these platforms, and I'd be happy to provide advice and assistance. If you have a Mac with Docker installed or Windows with WSL and Docker, you can still use the `cbot.sh` bash script for setting up and running a container-based robot on your Mac or Windows machine.

The rest of this section assumes you'll be installing **Gopherbot** from a pre-built archive or source on a Linux host.
