# Installation

> Up-to-date with v2.6

If you plan on running your **Gopherbot** robot in a container, you can skip ahead to [Team Chat Credentials](/botsetup/credentials.html). For reference, it might be useful to peruse the contents of the [Gopherbot install archive](/appendices/InstallArchive.html) describing what gets installed.

Note that Gopherbot is currently Linux-only. Earlier versions ran on MacOS - and even Windows - but these platforms have fallen out of use. Patches are welcome if you'd like to maintain one of these platforms, and I'd be happy to provide advice and assistance. If you have a Mac with Docker installed or Windows with WSL and Docker, you can still use the `cbot.sh` bash script for setting up and running a container-based robot on your Mac or Windows machine.

The rest of this section assumes you'll be installing **Gopherbot** from a pre-built archive or source on a Linux host.
